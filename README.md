Here are my laboratory works performed during the course "Nonlinear dynamic systems and chaos theory" at the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI.

> 1 lab - Construction of a bifurcation diagram and a graph of the dependence of the Lyapunov exponent on the parameter of a one-dimensional discrete mapping x_(n+1)=f(x_n) on a given interval of parameter values. Construction of iterative mapping diagrams.

> 2 lab - Construction of attraction pools for attractors of a two-dimensional discrete mapping (x_n+1, y_n+1) = (f(x_n, y_n), g(x_n, y_n)), when one of the attractors is a point at infinity. Construction of a phase portrait and calculation of Lyapunov exponents for the second attractor.

> 3 lab - Classification of stationary points, construction of direction fields and phase portraits.

> 4 lab - Finding stationary points of an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations, studying their stability. Construction of a phase portrait. Construction of the PoincarÃ© section (one-sided and two-sided) of the attractor of a dynamical system. Construction of a graph of the divergence of two nearby trajectories on the attractor (graph of the norm of the difference between solutions depending on time). Find the spectrum of Lyapunov attractor exponents.

> 5 lab - Construction of a bifurcation diagram of a dynamic system described by a non-autonomous differential equation. Calculation of the spectrum of Lyapunov attractor exponents for several parameter values. Finding the dimension of the attractor in two ways: using box-counting algorithm and using the Kaplan-York formula.
